Here is the link to the YouTube video of the code working on the Arduino. I have the IR remote linked to the serial monitor of
Arduino in order to show what button is pressed. It is hard to see the LED light up in the beginning of the video due to the
lighting of the room, so I recorded myself resetting the Arduino and you can clearly see the LED turn off as a result.
